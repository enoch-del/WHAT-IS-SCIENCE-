  <p></p>
  <hr> 
  <p> Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;<b>scientia </b>, meaning <u>"knowledge"</u>&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.</p>
  <hr> 
  <p>The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around <i>3500 to 3000 </i> BCE.</p>
  <hr>Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the&nbsp;physical world&nbsp;based on natural cause. 
  <p></p> 
  <hr>After the&nbsp;fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of&nbsp;Greek conceptions of the world&nbsp;deteriorated in&nbsp;Western Europe&nbsp;during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the&nbsp;Middle Ages but was preserved in the&nbsp;Muslim world&nbsp;during the&nbsp;Islamic 
  <golden age . < p>
   <hr>The recovery and assimilation of&nbsp;Greek works&nbsp;and&nbsp;Islamic inquiries&nbsp;into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy",[7][9]&nbsp;which was later transformed by the&nbsp;Scientific Revolution&nbsp;that began in the 16th century[10]&nbsp;as&nbsp;new ideas and discoveries&nbsp;departed from&nbsp;previous Greek conceptions&nbsp;and traditions.[11][12][13][14]&nbsp;The&nbsp;scientific method&nbsp;soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the&nbsp;19th century&nbsp;that many of the institutional and&nbsp;professional&nbsp;features of science began to take shape;[15][16][17]&nbsp;along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science."[18] Modern science&nbsp;is typically divided into three major&nbsp;branches&nbsp;that consist of the&nbsp;natural sciences&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;biology,&nbsp;chemistry, and&nbsp;physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the&nbsp;social sciences&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;economics,&nbsp;psychology, and&nbsp;sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the&nbsp;formal sciences&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;logic,&nbsp;mathematics, and&nbsp;theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,[19][20][21]&nbsp;however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on&nbsp;empirical evidence.[22][20]&nbsp;Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as&nbsp;engineering&nbsp;and medicine, are described as&nbsp;applied sciences.[23][24][25][26] Science is based on&nbsp;research, which is commonly conducted in&nbsp;academic&nbsp;and&nbsp;research institutions&nbsp;as well as in&nbsp;government agencies&nbsp;and&nbsp;companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of&nbsp;science policies&nbsp;that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of&nbsp;commercial products,&nbsp;armaments,&nbsp;health care, and&nbsp;environmental protection
